Our team has created and trained a gladiatorial-style fighter agent, Spartos, by utilizing Minecraftâ€™s Project Malmo platform. Like any respectable gladiator, Spartos will learn to defeat a variety of enemies in combat quickly and aggressively.

Source code: https://github.com/pooyakhosravi/SpartaCraft
Website code: https://hbbrennan.github.io/SpartaCraft/index.html

We styled our code using these implementations for inspiration:

- http://gym.openai.com/docs/

Training it at 15x speed is pretty cool.
