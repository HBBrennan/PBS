## Project Summary
Our ultimate goal for this Project in AI course was to create a Minecraft fighter bot, dubbed Spartos, whose survival instincts and tactical skills in the battle arena surpassed all others. In the original planning stages, we had envisioned a bot that was able to conquer 3 types of mobs in the arena: passive mobs, aggressive mobs, and endless mobs.
### Progress Iterations
Over the course of the quarter, we narrowed and refined our problem specifications to create the final iteration of Spartos: a fighter bot who specializes in the efficient eradication of aggressive mobs, specifically an aggressive mob of zombies.

To achieve this goal Spartos, we first distilled the problem to its simplest terms and built up from there. We began with a random agent in a small arena, with a single, non-pursuing zombie as its enemy. As Spartos adapted to this simple environment, we increased the difficulty: increasing the size of the arena, allowing the zombie to pursue Spartos, and increasing the number of zombies spawned.
### An AI Problem
Just on pure observation of the random agent alone, it is clear why AI/ML algorithms are needed for this problem. Even when we broke our problem down to its simplest terms, the random agent struggles with simply locating its opponent (see our Status video for a demonstration of this). And when we scaled our problem up to its final iteration (pursuant enemies in a large field), a random agent could not conceivably or consistently survive. Machine learning is necessary to solve our proposed problem in any significant way; the agent must learn to seek out its enemies, swing its sword when in range, and, if necessary, evade their attacks. (Please see below for specific details of our implementation approach.)
