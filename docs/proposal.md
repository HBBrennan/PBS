## Summary of the Project
In a paragraph or so, mention the main idea behind your project. Focus on the problem setup, not the solution, i.e.
what is your goal? At the very least, you should have a sentence that clearly explains the input/output semantics
of your project, i.e. what information will it take as input, and what will it produce. Mention any applications, if
any, for your project.

## AI/ML Algorithms
In a single sentence, mention the AI and ML algorithm(s) you anticipate using for your project. It does not
have to be a detailed description of the algorithm, even the sub-area of the field is sufficient. Examples of this
include “planning with dynamic programming”, “reinforcement learning with neural function approximator”,
“deep learning for images”, “min-max tree search with pruning”, and so on.
